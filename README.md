# README for FAQ Chatbot Streamlit App

## Overview
This app provides a simple chatbot interface for interacting with FAQ data stored in an SQLite database. It uses OpenAI's API for generating responses and displays the FAQ list for reference.

## Structure
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the app.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key in `app.py`.
3. Ensure `faq.db` exists in the parent directory (generated by your previous script).
4. Start the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Features
- Chatbot interface for user questions.
- FAQ list display from the database.

## Notes
- For production, consider using environment variables for API keys and more advanced retrieval using embeddings.
